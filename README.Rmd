# scDD: An R package to identify differentially distributed genes in scRNA-seq 
Version 0.99.3 of R Package 'scDD' (accepted to Bioconductor).  To access 
previous versions of the package (including 1.1.0 as used in the [Genome 
Biology publication]
(https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-1077-y), 
see the 
[Releases page](https://github.com/kdkorthauer/scDD/releases)).

Until it appears in Bioconductor, you can install through GitHub:

```R
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("kdkorthauer/scDD", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

For examples and tips on using the package, please see the vignette PDF, 
which you can bring up by typing 

```R
vignette("scDD"")
```

after installing and loading the package into R.  You can also preview the
text and code in the vignette (without the results it produces) in the raw
.Rnw file without first installing scDD by clicking [here](https://github.com/kdkorthauer/scDD/blob/master/vignettes/scDD.Rnw).
