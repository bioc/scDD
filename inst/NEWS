\section{Version 1.1.5, (2017-09-27)}{
  \itemize{
    \item{The input and output object of the main scDD function has been
     changed from SummarizedExperiment to SingleCellExperiment to increase
     interoperability among other Bioconductor packages}
    \item{The simulateSet function now returns a SingleCellExperiment object 
     (previously it returned an object in list format)}
    \item{The preprocess function now takes as input a SingleCellExperiment
     object instead of a list of data frames}
  }
}

\section{Version 1.0.0, Bioconductor 3.5 Release (2017-04-23)}{
  \itemize{
    \item{scDD is a package for identifying differentially distributed genes in
    single-cell RNA-seq data. It is designed to detect differences in 
    expression that are more complex than a simple mean shift, including:}
    \item{traditional differential expression (DE)}
    \item{differential modality (DM)}
    \item{differential proportion of cells in each state (DP)}
    \item{both differential modality and differential proportion (DB)}
  }

\section{Version 0.99.0 (2016-12-07)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Package prepared for Bioconductor submission.
