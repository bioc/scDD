\usage{
simulateSet(SCdat, numSamples = 100, nDE = 250, nDP = 250, nDM = 250,
  nDB = 250, nEE = 5000, nEP = 4000, sd.range = c(1, 3), modeFC = c(2,

}
\arguments{
\item{SCdat}{An object of class \code{SummarizedExperiment} that contains 
normalized single-cell expression and metadata. The \code{assays} 
  slot contains a named list of matrices, where the normalized counts are 
  housed in the one named \code{"NormCounts"}.  This matrix should have one
   row for each gene and one sample for each column.  
  The \code{colData} slot should contain a data.frame with one row per 
  sample and columns that contain metadata for each sample.  This data.frame
  should contain a variable that represents biological condition, which is 
  in the form of numeric values (either 1 or 2) that indicates which 
  condition each sample belongs to (in the same order as the columns of 
  \code{NormCounts}).  Optional additional metadata about each cell can also
  be contained in this data.frame, and additional information about the 
  experiment can be contained in the \code{metadata} slot as a list.}

\item{numSamples}{numeric value for the number of samples in each condition 
to simulate}

\item{nDE}{Number of DE genes to simulate}

\item{nDP}{Number of DP genes to simulate}

\item{nDM}{Number of DM genes to simulate}

\item{nDB}{Number of DB genes to simulate}

\item{nEE}{Number of EE genes to simulate}

\item{nEP}{Number of EP genes to simulate}

\item{sd.range}{Numeric vector of length two which describes the interval
(lower, upper) of standard deviations
of fold changes to randomly select.}

\item{modeFC}{Vector of values to use for fold changes between modes for DP,
DM, and DB.}

\item{plots}{Logical indicating whether or not to generate fold change and 
validation plots}

\item{plot.file}{Character containing the file string if the plots are to be
sent to a pdf instead of to the standard output.}

\item{random.seed}{Numeric value for a call to \code{set.seed} for 
reproducibility.}

\item{varInflation}{Optional numeric vector with one element for each 
condition that corresponds to the multiplicative 
 variance inflation factor to use when simulating data.  Useful for 
 sensitivity studies to assess the impact of 
 confounding effects on differential variance across conditions. Currently 
 assumes all samples within a 
 condition are subject to the same variance inflation factor.}

\item{condition}{A character object that contains the name of the column in 
\code{colData} that represents 
 the biological group or condition of interest (e.g. treatment versus 
 control).  Note that this variable should only contain two 
 possible values since \code{scDD} can currently only handle two-group 
 comparisons.  The default option assumes that there
 is a column named "condition" that contains this variable.}
}
\value{
A named list of two items: the first (labeled 'Simulated_Data') is a
 matrix of simulated 
  data with \code{numSamples} columns and \code{nDE + nDP + nDM + nDB + nEE
   + nEP} rows 
  (total number of genes).  The second item (named 'FC') is a vector of the
   number of standard 
  deviations used for fold changes. For DE genes, this value is computed 
  from the sampled fold
  changes obtained from \code{\link{findFC}}.  For DP, DM, DB, and EP genes,
   this is one of the 
  values in \code{modeFC}.  For EE genes, this value is \code{NA}.
}
\description{
Simulation of a complete dataset, where the number of each type of 
differential distributions and equivalent distributions is specified.
